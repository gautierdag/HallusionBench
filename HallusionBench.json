While the data I found does not explicitly break down the population into 5-year age groups like 50-54 and 0-4, we can infer from the broader age group categories that:  The 0-14 years age group, which includes 0-4 years, was a significant portion of the population. The 25-54 years age group, which includes 50-54 years, was the largest demographic segment. Given that the 25-54 years age group is much broader and accounts for nearly half of China's population, it's likely that the number of people aged 50-54 years was larger than those aged 0-4 years.

Therefore, the population of the younger age group (0-4 years) was significantly larger than that of the older age group (90-94 years).
